2005-2011
:   **PhD, Theoretical Chemistry**; University of Florida (Gainesville)

    *Thesis title: [Increasing the Applicability of Density Functional Theory](ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/uf/e0/04/28/48/00001/verma_p.pdf)*

      * Obtain Numerical proof of [Bartlett’s IP theorem](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4871409) and its importance in density functional theory.
      * Developed framework of [consistent](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4755818) density functional theory.
      * [Obtained](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3678180) self-consistent solution of random phase approximation..
      * [Proposed](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261411015120) analytical gradient scheme of non-variational
      density functional theory.
      * Invented computational inexpensive and accurate way to
        obtain [activation energies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261411015120), [ionization and core excitation energies.](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4955194)
      * Most of the computational tools were developed using Fortran77 in ACESII
