My name is Prakash Verma. Currently, in Gainesville, FL working as an adj. associate scientist at university of Florida. In layman's terms I develop computationally inexpensive and reasonably accuate methods that predict what will you see if go inside a molecules with a light source. If you are going in with an x-ray vision or uv light source, my methods can help you find out what are the things you saw. Electric and magnetic component of a light can do funny things to a molecules, understanding these things will help us get a fingerprint of a molecules and help predict how it will behave when brought in the vicinity of an another molecule.

My interest are :

- Data Science
- Recommendation Engine
- Density Functional theory
- Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
- Dielectric function and its relation with correlation
- Electron Spin Resonance
- Rydberg Fingerprint spectroscopy
- Linux
- Python
- Machine Learning



### my scientific accomplishments.

My biggest contribution to the science is realizing the importance of [Bartlett's IP Theorem](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4871409) in density functional theory.
